## Motivation

Inspired by large chess platforms such as lichess and chess.com, which have been generating puzzles from user games for years, I attempted to do the similar for renju enthusiasts.

Classic puzzles crafted by experts are well-designed with intricate traps. Real game VCTs may not be that tricky, but offer practical drills, and the opportunity to analyze the game to see how the position is reached.
