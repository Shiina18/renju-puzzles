# Renju Puzzles

[![feedback badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/feedback-点我反馈-blue?logo=coveralls)](https://www.wjx.cn/vm/ejFAuia.aspx)

This is just a simple demo by now.

All the puzzles are derived from real tournament games available on [RenjuNet](https://www.renju.net/). They are generated by scripts.

## Guide

Find VCTs. Very complicated puzzles are not listed.

For the answer, you may use the interactive board equipped with either AI (Rapfi) or VCT solver on the web apps whose links are attached under each puzzle. Also, the link of the source game is also attached.

You have to copy and paste the position code to use Gomocalc.
